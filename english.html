    <!-- SECTION 1: WHAT IS BC GAME REALLY? -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>What Is BC Game / Online Gambling Really?</h2>
        <p>
            BC Game looks like a fun game where you can double your money, win big and enjoy life.
            But in reality, it is an <strong>online casino system</strong>. The goal of any casino
            is not to make you rich. The goal is to make <strong>itself</strong> rich.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes you win, just enough to make you feel smart and lucky. But slowly, over time,
            you start increasing your bets, chasing your losses, and giving more and more money to the system.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: WHY YOU WILL ALWAYS LOSE IN THE LONG RUN -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Why You Will Always Lose in the Long Run</h2>
        <p>
            Every gambling game has something called a <strong>house edge</strong>. It means
            the system keeps a small mathematical advantage in every bet. You can win a few times,
            but if you keep playing again and again, the math will slowly pull all your money away.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Short term: small wins, excitement, confidence.</li>
            <li>Long term: repeated losses, frustration, regret.</li>
            <li>The more you play, the more the house edge eats your balance.</li>
            <li>“Recover loss” thinking pushes you into even bigger losses.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3: REAL-LIKE STORIES -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Real-Like Stories of Loss</h2>
        <p>
            These are example-type stories that show what happens to many people in BC Game and
            other online gambling platforms:
        </p>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>Story 1: From ₹500 to Huge Loss</h3>
            <p>
                A boy started with just ₹500. He won a little and felt confident. He thought
                he had learned a “pattern” in the game. Slowly he deposited more and more,
                increased his bet size and tried to recover every loss. After some months,
                he realised he had lost more than several lakhs. Today, he regrets that if
                he had used that money to learn a skill or start something real, his life
                would be completely different.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>Story 2: Loan for Gambling</h3>
            <p>
                A man took a loan thinking he would double it through BC Game. In the beginning,
                he won small amounts and felt he was on the right track. But within a short time,
                luck changed, and he lost everything. Now he has no money and a heavy loan on his head,
                with stress, guilt and no peace of mind.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>My Story (Example)</h3>
            <p>
                I also believed that I could beat the system. I played again and again, trying
                to find the “right moment” and “right pattern”. Instead of profit, I faced loss,
                mental stress and wasted time. This website is created so that you don’t repeat
                the same mistake.

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How Much Have You Really Lost?</h2>
        <p>
            Many people don’t calculate their total loss. They only remember a few wins and some big losses.
            Use this simple calculator to see a rough idea of how much money you have actually lost.

        <div class="calc-box">

    <!-- SECTION 6: SAFE ALTERNATIVES -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Safe Alternatives Instead of Gambling</h2>
        <p>
            If you use the same time and energy that you put into BC Game and gambling to learn a skill,
            your life can change in a real and permanent way. Here are some safer and meaningful options:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Learn coding / web development / app development.</li>
            <li>Start freelancing (logo design, writing, editing, etc.).</li>
            <li>Create content: YouTube, blogging, teaching online.</li>
            <li>Start a small online business or reselling product.</li>
            <li>Invest time in education, courses, and self-improvement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Gambling gives you a fake feeling of quick money. Skills give you real confidence, respect and
            long-term income.
